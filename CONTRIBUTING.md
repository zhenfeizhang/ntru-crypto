**Key branches**

1.	master is the latest, deployed version.

2.	gh-pages is the hosted docs (not to be used for pull requests).

3.	*-wip is the official work in progress branch for the next release.

Reporting issues
================
We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the ntru-crypto core. Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1.	Search for existing issues. We get a lot of duplicate issues, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.

2.	Create an isolated and reproducible test case. Provide a sample that reproduces the bug in 25 lines or less.

Share as much information as possible. Include operating system and version, browser and version, version of ntru-crypto, customized or vanilla build, etc. where appropriate. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.

Pull requests
=============
1.	Try to submit pull requests against the latest *-wip branch for easier merging

2.	Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes--keep them simple and small
